#Berrytron
This is a small Application emulating a Mellotron with samples from http://www.leisureland.us/audio/MellotronSamples/MellotronSamples.htm

It is working quite well, although it has a noticable latency.
It's using Midi-Inputs for triggering the sounds.
Also: Pygame. it's quite cool

you can get some help via `python berrytron.py -h`
This is, as you've might guessed by the name, intended for a raspberry pi.
